#Comments & Pound Characters
#Playing with comments into a source file
#Comments are not "print out" when the source code is run!

#Python version 2.7.6

#A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
#Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print "I could have code like this." #and comment after is ignored

#Comments can be used also to disable or commnet out a piece of code
#for example the following line of code will not run.
#print "Ahhahahahahha"

print "This will run instead!"
